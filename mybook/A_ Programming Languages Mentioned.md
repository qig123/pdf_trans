## **Programming Languages Mentioned**

**This appendix provides brief descriptions,** bibliographic references, and
(in many cases) URLs for on-line information concerning each of the principal
programming languages mentioned in this book. The URLs are accurate as of
June 2015, though they are subject to change as people move ﬁles around. Some
additional URLs can be found in the bibliographic references.
Bill Kinnersley maintains an index of on-line materials for approximately 2500
programming languages at* people.ku.edu/~nkinners/LangList/Extras/langlist.htm*.
Figure A.1 shows the genealogy of some of the more inﬂuential or widely used
programming languages. The date for each language indicates the approximate
time at which its features became widely known. Arrows indicate principal inﬂu-
ences on design. Many inﬂuences, of course, cannot be shown in a single ﬁgure.

```
Ada : Originally intended to be the standard language for all software commis-
sioned by the U.S. Department of Defense [Ame83], now standardized by the
ISO [Int12b]. Prototypes designed by teams at several sites; ﬁnal ’83 language
developed by a team at Honeywell’s Systems and Research Center in Min-
neapolis and Alsys Corp. in France, led by Jean Ichbiah. A very large language,
descended largely from Pascal. Design rationale articulated in a remarkably
clear companion document [IBFW91]. Ada 95 was a revision developed un-
der government contract by a team at Intermetrics, Inc. It ﬁxed several sub-
tle problems in the earlier language, and added objects, shared-memory syn-
chronization, and many other features. Ada 2005 and Ada 2012 add a host of
additional features; for a summary see ada2012.org/comparison.html. Freely
available implementation (gnat) distributed as part of the GNU compiler col-
lection (gcc). Additional resources at adaic.org/ and ada-europe.org/.
Algol 60 : The original block-structured language. The deﬁnition by Naur et al.
[NBB+63] is considered a landmark of clarity and conciseness. It includes the
original use of Backus-Naur Form (BNF).
Algol 68 : A large and relatively complex successor to Algol 60, designed by a
committee led by A. van Wijngaarden. Includes (among other things) struc-
tures and unions, expression-based syntax, reference parameters, a reference
model of variables, and concurrency. The ofﬁcial deﬁnition [vMP+75] uses

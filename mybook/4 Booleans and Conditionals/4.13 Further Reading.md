The algorithm for explicate_control is based on the expose-basic-blocks pass in the course notes of Dybvig and Keep (2010). It has similarities to the algorithms of Danvy (2003) and Appel and Palsberg (2003), and is related to translations into continuation passing style (van Wijngaarden 1966; Fischer 1972; Reynolds 1972; Plotkin 1975; Friedman, Wand, and Haynes 2001). The treatment of conditionals in the explicate_control pass is similar to short-cut Boolean evaluation (Logothetis and Mishra 1981; Aho et al. 2006; Clarke 1989; Danvy 2003) and the case-of-case transformation (Peyton Jones and Santos 1998).

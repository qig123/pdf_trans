6.4 Remove Complex Operands

The forms collect, allocate, and global_value should be treated as complex operands. Figure 6.11 shows the grammar for the output language Lmon Alloc of this pass, which is LAlloc in monadic normal form.

6.5 Explicate Control and the CTup Language

The output of explicate_control is a program in the intermediate language CTup, for which figure 6.12 shows the definition of the abstract syntax. The new expres- sions of CTup include allocate, vector-ref, and vector-set!, and global_value. CTup also includes the new collect statement. The explicate_control pass can treat these new forms much like the other forms that weâ€™ve already encountered. The output of the explicate_control pass on the running example is shown on the left side of figure 6.15 in the next section.

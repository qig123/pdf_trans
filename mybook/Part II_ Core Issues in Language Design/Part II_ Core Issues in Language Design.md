# Part II: Core Issues in Language Design

II Core Issues in Language Design

Having laid the foundation in Part I, we now turn to issues that lie at the core of most program- ming languages: control ﬂow, data types, and abstractions of both control and data. Chapter 6 considers control ﬂow, including expression evaluation, sequencing, selection, iteration, and recursion. In many cases we will see design decisions that reﬂect the sometimes complementary but often competing goals of conceptual clarity and efﬁcient implementation. Several issues, including the distinction between references and values and between applicative (eager) and lazy evaluation, will recur in later chapters. The next two chapters consider the subject of types. Chapter 7 covers type systems and type checking, including the notions of equivalence, compatibility, and inference of types. It also considers the subject of parametric polymorphism, in both its implicit and explicit (generic) forms. Chapter 8 then presents a survey of concrete composite types, including records and variants, arrays, strings, sets, pointers, lists, and ﬁles. The section on pointers includes an introduction to garbage collection techniques. Both control and data are amenable to abstraction, the process whereby complexity is hid- den behind a simple and well-deﬁned interface. Control abstraction is the subject of Chap- ter 9. Subroutines are the most common control abstraction, but we also consider exceptions and coroutines, and return brieﬂy to the subjects of continuations and iterators, introduced in Chapter 6. The coverage of subroutines focuses on calling sequences and on parameter-passing mechanisms. Chapter 10 returns to the subject of data abstraction, introduced in Chapter 3. In many modern languages this subject takes the form of object orientation, characterized by an encapsu- lation mechanism, inheritance, and dynamic method dispatch (subtype polymorphism). Our coverage of object-oriented languages will also touch on constructors, access control, generics, closures, and mix-in and multiple inheritance.

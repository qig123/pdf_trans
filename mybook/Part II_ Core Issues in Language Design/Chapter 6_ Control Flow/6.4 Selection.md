# 6.4 Selection

6.4 Selection

procedure rand(ref n : integer)

but most programmers would ﬁnd this less appealing. Ada strikes a compromise:
it allows side effects in functions in the form of changes to static or global vari-
ables, but does not allow a function to modify its parameters.

## 6.4

**Selection**
Selection statements in most imperative languages employ some variant of the
**EXAMPLE** 6.46

```
Selection in Algol 60
if... then ... else notation introduced in Algol 60:
```

```
if condition then statement
else if condition then statement
else if condition then statement
...
else statement
■
```

```
As we saw in Section 2.3.2, languages differ in the details of the syntax. In Algol
60 and Pascal both the then clause and the else clause were deﬁned to contain
a single statement (this could of course be a begin... end compound statement).
To avoid grammatical ambiguity, Algol 60 required that the statement after the
then begin with something other than if (begin is ﬁne). Pascal eliminated this
restriction in favor of a “disambiguating rule” that associated an else with the
closest unmatched then. Algol 68, Fortran 77, and more modern languages avoid
the ambiguity by allowing a statement list to follow either then or else, with a
terminating keyword at the end of the construct.
To keep terminators from piling up at the end of nested if statements, most
EXAMPLE 6.47
```

```
elsif/elif
languages with terminators provide a special elsif or elif keyword. In Ruby,
one writes
```

```
if a == b then
...
elsif a == c then
...
elsif a == d then
...
else
...
end
■
```

In Lisp, the equivalent construct is
**EXAMPLE** 6.48

```
cond in Lisp
(cond
((= A B)
(...))
```

```
case statements and
nested ifs
for a special case of nested if... then ... else. When each condition compares
the same expression to a different compile-time constant, then the following code
(written here in Ada)
```

```
i := ... -- potentially complicated expression
if i = 1 then
clause A
elsif i = 2 or i = 7 then
clause B
elsif i in 3..5 then
clause C
elsif i = 10 then
clause D
else
clause E
end if;
```

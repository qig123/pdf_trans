# 10.7 Object-Oriented Programming Revisited

**522**
Chapter 10* Data Abstraction and Object Orientation*

Multiple inheritance with a common “grandparent” is known as* repeated* in-
heritance. Repeated inheritance with separate copies of the grandparent is known
as* replicated* inheritance; repeated inheritance with a single copy of the grandpar-
ent is known as* shared* inheritance. Shared inheritance is the default in Eiffel.
Replicated inheritance is the default in C++. Both languages allow the program-
mer to obtain the other option when desired.

**Object-Oriented Programming Revisited**
```
At the beginning of this chapter, we characterized object-oriented programming
in terms of three fundamental concepts: encapsulation, inheritance, and dynamic
method binding. Encapsulation allows the implementation details of an abstrac-
tion to be hidden behind a simple interface. Inheritance allows a new abstraction
to be deﬁned as an extension or reﬁnement of some existing abstraction, obtain-
ing some or all of its characteristics automatically. Dynamic method binding al-
lows the new abstraction to display its new behavior even when used in a context
that expects the old abstraction.
Different programming languages support these fundamental concepts to dif-
ferent degrees. In particular, languages differ in the extent to which they require
the programmer to write in an object-oriented style. Some authors argue that
a truly object-oriented language should make it difﬁcult or impossible to write
programs that are not object-oriented. From this purist point of view, an object-
oriented language should present a uniform object model of computing, in which
every data type is a class, every variable is a reference to an object, and every
subroutine is an object method. Moreover, objects should be thought of in an-
thropomorphic terms: as active entities responsible for all computation.
Smalltalk and Ruby come close to this ideal. In fact, as described in the subsec-
tion below (mostly on the companion site), even such control-ﬂow mechanisms
as selection and iteration are modeled as method invocations in Smalltalk. On the
other hand, Ada 95 and Fortran 2003 are probably best characterized as von Neu-
mann languages that permit the programmer to write in an object-oriented style
if desired.
So what about C++? It certainly has a wealth of features, including several
(multiple inheritance, elaborate access control, strict initialization order, destruc-
tors, generics) that are useful in object-oriented programs and that are not found
in Smalltalk. At the same time, it has a wealth of problematic wrinkles. Its
simple types are not classes. It has subroutines outside of classes. It uses static
method binding and replicated multiple inheritance by default, rather than the
more costly virtual alternatives. Its unchecked C-style type casts provide a ma-
jor loophole for type checking and access control. Its lack of garbage collection is
a major obstacle to the creation of correct, self-contained abstractions. Probably
most serious of all, C++ retains all of the low-level mechanisms of C, allowing
the programmer to escape or subvert the object-oriented model of programming
```

**IN MORE DEPTH**

We have mentioned several features of Smalltalk in previous sections. A some-
what longer treatment can be found on the companion site, where we focus in
particular on Smalltalk’s anthropomorphic programming model. A full intro-
duction to the language is beyond the scope of this book.

43. Outline a possible implementation of mix-in inheritance for a language with
statically typed objects. Explain in particular the need for interface-speciﬁc
*view*s of an object.
44. Describe how mix-ins (and their implementation) can be extended with de-
fault method implementations, static (constant) ﬁelds, and even mutable
ﬁelds.
45. What does true multiple inheritance make possible that mix-in inheritance
does not?

Alan Kay (1940–) joined PARC in 1972. In addition to developing Smalltalk and its graphical
user interface, he conceived and promoted the idea of the laptop computer, well before it was
feasible to build one. He became a Fellow at Apple Computer in 1984, and has subsequently held
positions at Disney and Hewlett-Packard. He received the ACM Turing Award in 2003.

(c) Give assembly-level pseudocode for the call to c.ping at line 17. Again, assume that the address of c is in register r1, that this is the same register that should be used to pass this, and that you don’t need to save or restore any registers. (d) Give assembly-levelpseudocode for the body of method Counter.ping (again ignoring register save/restore).

10.22 In Ruby, as in Java 8 or Scala, an interface (mix-in) can provide method code as well as signatures. (It can’t provide data members; that would be multiple inheritance.) Explain why dynamic typing makes this feature more powerful than it is in the other languages.

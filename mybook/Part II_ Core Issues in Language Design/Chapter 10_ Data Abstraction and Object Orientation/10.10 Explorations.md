```
(c)
Give assembly-level pseudocode for the call to c.ping at line 17.
Again, assume that the address of c is in register r1, that this is the
same register that should be used to pass this, and that you don’t
need to save or restore any registers.
(d) Give assembly-levelpseudocode for the body of method Counter.ping
(again ignoring register save/restore).
```

### 10.22

In Ruby, as in Java 8 or Scala, an interface (mix-in) can provide method
code as well as signatures. (It can’t provide data members; that would
be multiple inheritance.) Explain why dynamic typing makes this feature
more powerful than it is in the other languages.

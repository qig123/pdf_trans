In a nutshell, generics exist for the purpose of abstracting over unrelated types,
something that inheritance does not support. In addition to C++, generics appear
in most other statically typed object-oriented languages, including Eiffel, Java, C#,
and OCaml.

languages.

the extensive polymorphism already provided by inheritance.

## 10.2

**Encapsulation and Inheritance**
Encapsulation mechanisms enable the programmer to group data and the sub-
routines that operate on them together in one place, and to hide irrelevant
details from the users of an abstraction.
In the preceding section (and like-
wise Section 3.3.5) we cast object-oriented programming as an extension of the

**Exception Handling**
Several times in the preceding chapters and sections we have referred to* exception-*
*handling* mechanisms. We have delayed detailed discussion of these mechanisms
until now because exception handling generally requires the language implemen-
tation to “unwind” the subroutine call stack.
An exception can be deﬁned as an unexpected—or at least unusual—condition
that arises during program execution, and that cannot easily be handled in the
local context. It may be detected automatically by the language implementation,
or the program may* raise* or* throw* it explicitly (the two terms are synonymous).
The most common exceptions are various sorts of run-time errors. In an I/O
library, for example, an input routine may encounter the end of its ﬁle before it
can read a requested value, or it may ﬁnd punctuation marks or letters on the

```
In Modula-3, the parameters are included in the exception declaration, much as
they are in a subroutine header (the Modula-3 empty_queue in Example 9.38
has no parameters). In Ada, the standard Exceptions library can be used to
pass information from a raise statement to a handler. Without the library, an
exception is simply a tag, with no value other than its name.
■
If a subroutine raises an exception but does not catch it internally, it may
“return” in an unexpected way. This possibility is an important part of the rou-
tine’s interface to the rest of the program. Consequently, several languages, in-
cluding Modula-3, C++, and Java, include in each subroutine header a list of

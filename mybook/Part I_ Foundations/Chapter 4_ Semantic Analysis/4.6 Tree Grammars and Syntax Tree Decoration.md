IN MORE DEPTH

We consider attribute space management in more detail on the companion site. Using bottom-up and top-down grammars for arithmetic expressions, we illus- trate automatic management for both bottom-up and top-down parsers, as well as the ad hoc option for top-down parsers.

4.6 Tree Grammars and Syntax Tree Decoration

In our discussion so far we have used attribute grammars solely to decorate parse trees. As we mentioned in the chapter introduction, attribute grammars can also be used to decorate syntax trees. If our compiler uses action routines simply to build a syntax tree, then the bulk of semantic analysis and intermediate code gen- eration will use the syntax tree as base. Figure 4.11 contains a bottom-up CFG for a calculator language with types and EXAMPLE 4.14

declarations. The grammar differs from that of Example 2.37 in three ways: (1) we allow declarations to be intermixed with statements, (2) we differentiate between integer and real constants (presumably the latter contain a decimal point), and (3) we require explicit conversions between integer and real operands. The intended semantics of our language requires that every identiﬁer be declared before it is used, and that types not be mixed in computations. ■ Extrapolating from the example in Figure 4.5, it is easy to add semantic func- EXAMPLE 4.15

The obvious structure for such a tree would represent expressions as we did in Figure 4.7, and would represent a pro- gram as a linked list of declarations and statements. As a concrete example, Fig- ure 4.12 contains the syntax tree for a simple program to print the average of an integer and a real. ■

Much as a context-free grammar describes the possible structure of parse trees EXAMPLE 4.16

for a given programming language, we can use a tree grammar to represent the possible structure of syntax trees. As in a CFG, each production of a tree grammar represents a possible relationship between a parent and its children in the tree. The parent is the symbol on the left-hand side of the production; the children are the symbols on the right-hand side. The productions used in Figure 4.12 might look something like the following:

Tree grammar for the calculator language with types

program −→item

int decl : item −→id item

read : item −→id item

real decl : item −→id item

write : item −→expr item

null : item −→ϵ

‘÷’ : expr −→expr expr

‘+’ : expr −→expr expr

ﬂoat : expr −→expr

id : expr −→ϵ

real const : expr −→ϵ

Here the notation A : B on the left-hand side of a production means that A is one variant of B, and may appear anywhere a B is expected on a right-hand side. ■

Tree grammars and context-free grammars differ in important ways. A context-free grammar is meant to deﬁne (generate) a language composed of strings of tokens, where each string is the fringe (yield) of a parse tree. Pars- ing is the process of ﬁnding a tree that has a given yield. A tree grammar, as we use it here, is meant to deﬁne (or generate) the trees themselves. We have no need for a notion of parsing: we can easily inspect a tree and determine whether (and how) it can be generated by the grammar. Our purpose in introducing tree gram- mars is to provide a framework for the decoration of syntax trees. Semantic rules attached to the productions of a tree grammar can be used to deﬁne the attribute ﬂow of a syntax tree in exactly the same way that semantic rules attached to the productions of a context-free grammar are used to deﬁne the attribute ﬂow of a parse tree. We will use a tree grammar in the remainder of this section to perform static semantic checking. In Chapter 15 we will show how additional semantic rules can be used to generate intermediate code. A complete tree attribute grammar for our calculator language with types can EXAMPLE 4.17

Tree AG for the calculator language with types be constructed using the node classes, variants, and attributes shown in Fig- ure 4.13. The grammar itself appears in Figure 4.14. Once decorated, the program node at the root of the syntax tree will contain a list, in a synthesized attribute, of all static semantic errors in the program. (The list will be empty if the pro- gram is free of such errors.) Each item or expr node has an inherited attribute symtab that contains a list, with types, of all identiﬁers declared to the left in the tree. Each item node also has an inherited attribute errors in that lists all static semantic errors found to its left in the tree, and a synthesized attribute errors out to propagate the ﬁnal error list back to the root. Each expr node has one synthe- sized attribute that indicates its type and another that contains a list of any static semantic errors found inside. Our handling of semantic errors illustrates a common technique. In order to continue looking for other errors, we must provide values for any attributes that would have been set in the absence of an error. To avoid cascading error mes- sages, we choose values for those attributes that will pass quietly through subse- quent checks. In this speciﬁc case we employ a pseudotype called error, which

![Figure 4.14 Attribute grammar...](images/page_237_vector_518.png)
*Figure 4.14 Attribute grammar to decorate an abstract syntax tree for the calculator lan- guage with types. We use square brackets to delimit error messages and pointed brackets to delimit symbol table entries. Juxtaposition indicates concatenation within error messages; the ‘+’ and ‘−’ operators indicate insertion and removal in lists. We assume that every node has been initialized by the scanner or by action routines in the parser to contain an indication of the location (line and column) at which the corresponding construct appears in the source (see Exercise 4.22). The ‘?’ symbol is used as a “wild card”; it matches any type. (continued)*

we associate with any symbol table entry or expression for which we have already generated a message. Though it takes a bit of checking to verify the fact, our attribute grammar is noncircular and well deﬁned. No attribute is ever assigned a value more than once. (The helper routines at the end of Figure 4.14 should be thought of as macros, rather than semantic functions. For the sake of brevity we have passed them entire tree nodes as arguments. Each macro calculates the values of two dif- ferent attributes. Under a strict formulation of attribute grammars each macro

would be replaced by two separate semantic functions, one per calculated at- tribute.) ■ Figure 4.15 uses the grammar of Figure 4.14 to decorate the syntax tree of EXAMPLE 4.18

Decorating a tree with the AG of Example 4.17 Figure 4.12. The pattern of attribute ﬂow appears considerably messier than in previous examples in this chapter, but this is simply because type checking is more complicated than calculating constants or building a syntax tree. Symbol table information ﬂows along the chain of items and down into expr trees. The int decl and real decl nodes add new information; other nodes simply pass the table along. Type information is synthesized at id : expr leaves by looking up an identiﬁer’s name in the symbol table. The information then propagates upward within an expression tree, and is used to type-check operators and assignments (the latter don’t appear in this example). Error messages ﬂow along the chain of items via the errors in attributes, and then back to the root via the errors out attributes. Messages also ﬂow up out of expr trees. Wherever a type check is performed, the type attribute may be used to help create a new message to be appended to the growing message list. ■ In our example grammar we accumulate error messages into a synthesized at- tribute of the root of the syntax tree. In an ad hoc attribute evaluator we might be tempted to print these messages on the ﬂy as the errors are discovered. In prac-

tice, however, particularly in a multipass compiler, it makes sense to buffer the messages, so they can be interleaved with messages produced by other phases of the compiler, and printed in program order at the end of compilation. One could convert our attribute grammar into executable code using an au- tomatic attribute evaluator generator. Alternatively, one could create an ad hoc evaluator in the form of mutually recursive subroutines (Exercise 4.20). In the lat- ter case attribute ﬂow would be explicit in the calling sequence of the routines. We could then choose if desired to keep the symbol table in global variables, rather than passing it from node to node through attributes. Most compilers employ the ad hoc approach.

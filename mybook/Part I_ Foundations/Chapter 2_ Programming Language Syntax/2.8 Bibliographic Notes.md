2.38 Some languages (e.g., C) distinguish between upper- and lowercase letters
in identiﬁers. Others (e.g., Ada) do not. Which convention do you prefer?
Why?
2.39 The syntax for type casts in C and its descendants introduces potential am-
biguity: is (x)-y a subtraction, or the unary negation of y, cast to type x?
Find out how C, C++, Java, and C# answer this question. Discuss how you
would implement the answer(s).
2.40 What do you think of Haskell, Occam, and Python’s use of indentation
to delimit control constructs (Section 2.1.1)? Would you expect this con-
vention to make program construction and maintenance easier or harder?
Why?
2.41 Skip ahead to Section 14.4.2 and learn about the “regular expressions” used
in scripting languages, editors, search tools, and so on. Are these really
regular? What can they express that cannot be expressed in the notation
introduced in Section 2.1.1?
2.42 Rebuild the automaton of Exercise 2.8 using lex/flex.
2.43 Find a manual for yacc/bison, or consult a compiler textbook [ALSU07,
Secs. 4.8.1 and 4.9.2] to learn about operator precedence parsing. Explain
how it could be used to simplify the grammar of Exercise 2.16.
2.44 Use lex/flex and yacc/bison to construct a parser for the calculator lan-
guage. Have it output a trace of its shifts and reductions.
2.45 Repeat the previous exercise using ANTLR.

**Bibliographic Notes**
```
Our coverage of scanning and parsing in this chapter has of necessity been
brief. Considerably more detail can be found in texts on parsing theory [AU72]
and compiler construction [ALSU07, FCL10, App97, GBJ+12, CT04].
Many
compilers of the early 1960s employed recursive descent parsers.
Lewis and
Stearns [LS68] and Rosenkrantz and Stearns [RS70] published early formal stud-
ies of LL grammars and parsing. The original formulation of LR parsing is due to
Knuth [Knu65]. Bottom-up parsing became practical with DeRemer’s discovery
of the SLR and LALR algorithms [DeR71]. W. L. Johnson et al. [JPAR68] describe
an early scanner generator. The Unix lex tool is due to Lesk [Les75]. Yacc is due
to S. C. Johnson [Joh75].
Further details on formal language theory can be found in a variety of
textbooks, including those of Hopcroft, Motwani, and Ullman [HMU07] and

**The Art of Language Design**
Today there are thousands of high-level programming languages, and new ones
continue to emerge. Why are there so many? There are several possible answers:

```
Evolution. Computer science is a young discipline; we’re constantly ﬁnding bet-
ter ways to do things. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a revolution in
“structured programming,” in which the goto-based control ﬂow of languages
like Fortran, Cobol, and Basic3 gave way to while loops, case (switch)
statements, and similar higher-level constructs. In the late 1980s the nested
block structure of languages like Algol, Pascal, and Ada began to give way to
the object-oriented structure of languages like Smalltalk, C++, Eiffel, and—a
decade later—Java and C#. More recently, scripting languages like Python and
Ruby have begun to displace more traditional compiled languages, at least for
rapid development.
Special Purposes. Some languages were designed for a speciﬁc problem domain.
The various Lisp dialects are good for manipulating symbolic data and com-
plex data structures.
Icon and Awk are good for manipulating character
strings. C is good for low-level systems programming. Prolog is good for rea-
soning about logical relationships among data. Each of these languages can be
used successfully for a wider range of tasks, but the emphasis is clearly on the
specialty.
Personal Preference. Different people like different things. Much of the parochi-
alism of programming is simply a matter of taste. Some people love the terse-
ness of C; some hate it. Some people ﬁnd it natural to think recursively; others
prefer iteration. Some people like to work with pointers; others prefer the im-
plicit dereferencing of Lisp, Java, and ML. The strength and variety of personal
preference make it unlikely that anyone will ever develop a universally accept-
able programming language.
```

Of course, some languages are more successful than others. Of the many that
have been designed, only a few dozen are widely used. What makes a language
successful? Again there are several answers:

*Expressive Power.* One commonly hears arguments that one language is more
“powerful” than another, though in a formal mathematical sense they are all

The names of these languages are sometimes written entirely in uppercase letters and sometimes
in mixed case. For consistency’s sake, I adopt the convention in this book of using mixed case for
languages whose names are pronounced as words (e.g., Fortran, Cobol, Basic), and uppercase for
those pronounced as a series of letters (e.g., APL, PL/I, ML).

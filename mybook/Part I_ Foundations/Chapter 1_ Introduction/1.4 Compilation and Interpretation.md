**Compilation and Interpretation**
At the highest level of abstraction, the compilation and execution of a program in

a high-level language look something like this:

Source program

Compiler

Input
Target program
Output

The compiler* translates* the high-level source program into an equivalent target
program (typically in machine language), and then goes away. At some arbitrary
later time, the user tells the operating system to run the target program. The com-
piler is the locus of control during compilation; the target program is the locus of
control during its own execution. The compiler is itself a machine language pro-
gram, presumably created by compiling some other high-level program. When
written to a ﬁle in a format understood by the operating system, machine lan-
guage is commonly known as* object code*.

An alternative style of implementation for high-level languages is known as

Pure interpretation
*interpretation*:

Interpreter
Source program

Input

Output

Unlike a compiler, an interpreter stays around for the execution of the appli-
cation. In fact, the interpreter is the locus of control during that execution. In
effect, the interpreter implements a virtual machine whose “machine language”
is the high-level programming language. The interpreter reads statements in that
language more or less one at a time, executing them as it goes along.
■
In general, interpretation leads to greater ﬂexibility and better diagnostics (er-
ror messages) than does compilation. Because the source code is being executed
directly, the interpreter can include an excellent source-level debugger. It can also
cope with languages in which fundamental characteristics of the program, such as
the sizes and types of variables, or even which names refer to which variables, can
depend on the input data. Some language features are almost impossible to im-
plement without interpretation: in Lisp and Prolog, for example, a program can
write new pieces of itself and execute them on the ﬂy. (Several scripting languages
also provide this capability.) Delaying decisions about program implementation
until run time is known as* late binding*; we will discuss it at greater length in
Section 3.1.

Such* source-to-source* translation is particularly common in research languages
and during the early stages of language development. One famous example was
AT&T’s original compiler for C++. This was indeed a true compiler, though
it generated C instead of assembler: it performed a complete analysis of the
syntax and semantics of the C++ source program, and with very few excep-

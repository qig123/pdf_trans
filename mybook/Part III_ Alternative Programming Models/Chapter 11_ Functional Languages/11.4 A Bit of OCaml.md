**A Bit of OCaml**
Like Lisp, ML has a complicated family tree. The original language was devised
in the early 1970s by Robin Milner and others at Cambridge University. SML
(“Standard” ML) and OCaml (Objective Caml) are the two most widely used di-
alects today. Haskell, the most widely used language for functional programming
research, is a separate descendant of ML (by way of Miranda). F#, developed by
Microsoft and others, is a descendant of OCaml.
Work on OCaml (and its predecessor, Caml) has been led since the early 1980s
by researchers at INRIA, the French national computing research organization
(the ‘O’ was added to the name with the introduction of object-oriented features

Programmers make heavy use of lists in most functional languages, and OCaml
is no exception. Lists are naturally recursive, and lend themselves to manipula-
tion with recursive functions. In scripting languages and dialects of Lisp, all of
which are dynamically typed, lists can be heterogeneous—a single list may con-
tain values of multiple, arbitrary types. In ML and its descendants, which perform
**EXAMPLE** 11.29

Polymorphic list operators
all checking at compile time, lists must be homogeneous—all elements must have
the same type. At the same time, functions that manipulate lists without perform-
ing operations on their members can take any kind of list as argument—they are
naturally polymorphic:

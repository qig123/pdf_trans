In the previous exercise you may have noticed that the dining philosophers
are prone to deadlock. One has to worry about the possibility that all ﬁve
of them will pick up their right-hand forks simultaneously, and then wait
forever for their left-hand neighbors to ﬁnish eating.
Discuss as many strategies as you can think of to address the deadlock
problem. Can you describe a solution in which it is provably impossible
for any philosopher to go hungry forever? Can you describe a solution that
is fair in a strong sense of the word (i.e., in which no one philosopher gets
more chance to eat than some other over the long term)? For a particularly
elegant solution, see the paper by Chandy and Misra [CM84].

In some concurrent programming systems, global variables are shared by
all threads. In others, each newly created thread has a separate copy of
the global variables, commonly initialized to the values of the globals of
the creating thread. Under this private globals approach, shared data must
be allocated from a special heap. In still other programming systems, the
programmer can specify which global variables are to be private and which
are to be shared.
Discuss the tradeoffs between private and shared global variables.
Which would you prefer to have available, for which sorts of programs?
How would you implement each? Are some options harder to implement
than others? To what extent do your answers depend on the nature of
processes provided by the operating system?

Rewrite Example 13.51 in Java.

AND parallelism in logic languages is analogous to the parallel evaluation
of arguments in a functional language (e.g., Multilisp). Does OR par-
allelism have a similar analog? (Hint: Think about special forms [Sec-
tion 11.5].) Can you suggest a way to obtain the effect of OR parallelism
in Multilisp?
13.33
In Section 13.4.5 we claimed that both AND parallelism and OR paral-
lelism were problematic in Prolog, because they failed to adhere to the
deterministic search order required by language semantics. Elaborate on
this claim. What speciﬁcally can go wrong?

The MMX, SSE, and AVX extensions to the x86 instruction set and the Al-
tiVec extensions to the Power instruction set make vector operations avail-
able to general-purpose code. Learn about these instructions and research
their history. What sorts of code are they used for? How are they related
to vector supercomputers? To modern graphics processors?

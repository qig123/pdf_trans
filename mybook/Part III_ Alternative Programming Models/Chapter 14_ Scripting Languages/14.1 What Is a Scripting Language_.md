dynamic (run-time) checking. Their type systems, likewise, tend to embrace such
high-level concepts as tables, patterns, lists, and ﬁles.
General-purpose scripting languages like Perl, Python, and Ruby are some-
times called* glue languages*, because they were originally designed to “glue” ex-
isting programs together to build a larger system. With the growth of the World
Wide Web, scripting languages have become the standard way to generate dy-
namic content, both on servers and with the client browser. They are also widely
used to customize or extend the functionality of such “scriptable” systems as edi-
tors, spreadsheets, games, and presentation tools.
We consider the history and nature of scripting in more detail in Section 14.1.
We then turn in Section 14.2 to some of the problem domains in which scripting
is widely used. These include command interpretation (shells), text processing
and report generation, mathematics and statistics, general-purpose program co-
ordination, and conﬁguration and extension. In Section 14.3 we consider several
forms of scripting used on the World Wide Web, including CGI scripts, server-
and client-side processing of scripts embedded in web pages, Java applets, and
(on the companion site) XSLT. Finally, in Section 14.4, we consider some of the
more interesting language features, common to many scripting languages, that
distinguish them from their more traditional “mainstream” cousins. We look in
particular at naming, scoping, and typing; string and pattern manipulation; and
high-level structured data. We will not provide a detailed introduction to any one
scripting language, though we will consider concrete examples in several. As in
most of this book, the emphasis will be on underlying concepts.
## 14.1

**What Is a Scripting Language?**
```
Modern scripting languages have two principal sets of ancestors. In one set are the
command interpreters or “shells” of traditional batch and “terminal” (command-
line) computing. In the other set are various tools for text processing and report
generation. Examples in the ﬁrst set include IBM’s JCL, the MS-DOS command
interpreter, and the Unix sh and csh shell families. Examples in the second set
include IBM’s RPG and Unix’s sed and awk. From these evolved Rexx, IBM’s
“Restructured Extended Executor,” which dates from 1979, and Perl, originally
devised by Larry Wall in the late 1980s, and still one of the most widely used
general-purpose scripting languages. Other general-purpose scripting languages
include Python, Ruby, PowerShell (for Windows), and AppleScript (for the Mac).
With the growth of the World Wide Web in the late 1990s, Perl was widely
adopted for “server-side” web scripting, in which a web server executes a pro-
gram (on the server’s machine) to generate the content of a page. One early
web-scripting enthusiast was Rasmus Lerdorf, who created a collection of scripts
to track access to his personal home page. Originally written in Perl but soon
redesigned as a full-ﬂedged and independent language, these scripts evolved into
PHP, now the most popular platform for server-side web scripting. PHP competi-
tors include JSP (Java Server Pages), Ruby on Rails, and, on Microsoft platforms,
```

While it is difﬁcult to deﬁne scripting languages precisely, there are several char-
acteristics that they tend to have in common:

*Both batch and interactive use.* A few scripting languages (notably Perl) have a
compiler that insists on reading the entire source program before it produces
any output. Most other languages, however, are willing to compile or inter-
pret their input line by line. Rexx, Python, Tcl, Guile, and (with short helper
scripts) Ruby and Lua will all accept commands from the keyboard.

in Perl, Python, or Ruby it is simply

```
print "Hello, world!\n"
■
```

*Lack of declarations; simple scoping rules.* Most scripting languages dispense with
declarations, and provide simple rules to govern the scope of names. In some
languages (e.g., Perl) everything is global by default; optional declarations can
be used to limit a variable to a nested scope. In other languages (e.g., PHP
and Tcl), everything is local by default; globals must be explicitly imported.
Python adopts the interesting rule that any variable that is assigned a value is
local to the block in which the assignment appears. Special syntax is required
to assign to a variable in a surrounding scope.

**DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION**

14.1 Compiling interpreted languages
Several times in this chapter we will make reference to “the compiler” for a
scripting language. As we saw in Examples 1.9 and 1.10, interpreters almost
never work with source code; a front-end translator ﬁrst replaces that source
with some sort of intermediate form. For most implementations of most of
the languages described in this chapter, the front end is sufﬁciently complex
to deserve the name “compiler.” Intermediate forms are typically internal data
structures (e.g., a syntax tree) or “byte-code” representations reminiscent of
those of Java.

14.15
Write a Perl script to ﬁnd, for each input line, the longest substring that
appears at least twice within the line, without overlapping. (Warning: This
is harder than it sounds. Remember that by default Perl searches for a left-
most longest match.)
14.16
Perl provides an alternative (?:... ) form of parentheses that supports
grouping in regular expressions without performing capture. Using this
syntax, Example 14.57 could have been written as follows:
```

```
if (/^([+-]?)((\d+)\.|(\d*)\.(\d+))(?:e([+-]?\d+))?$/) {
# floating-point number
print "sign:
", $1, "\n";
print "integer:
", $3, $4, "\n";
print "fraction: ", $5, "\n";
print "mantissa: ", $2, "\n";
print "exponent: ", $6, "\n";
# not $7
}
```

```
What purpose does this extra notation serve? Why might the code here be
preferable to that of Example 14.57?
14.17
Consider again the sed code of Figure 14.1. It is tempting to write the ﬁrst
of the compound statements as follows (note the differences in the three
substitution commands):
```

```
/<[hH][123]>.*<\/[hH][123]>/ {
;# match whole heading
h
;# save copy of pattern space
s/^.*\(<[hH][123]>\)/\1/
;# delete text before opening tag
s/\(<\/[hH][123]>\).*$/\1/
;# delete text after closing tag
p
;# print what remains
g
;# retrieve saved pattern space
s/^.*<\/[hH][123]>//
;# delete through closing tag
b top
```

```
Explain why this doesn’t work. (Hint: Remember the difference between
greedy and minimal matches [Example 14.53]. Sed lacks the latter.)
14.18
Consider the following regular expression in Perl:
/^(?:((?:ab)+)
|a((?:ba)*))$/. Describe, in English, the set of strings it will match.
Show a natural NFA for this set, together with the minimal DFA. Describe
the substrings that should be captured in each matching string. Based on
this example, discuss the practicality of using DFAs to match strings in
Perl.

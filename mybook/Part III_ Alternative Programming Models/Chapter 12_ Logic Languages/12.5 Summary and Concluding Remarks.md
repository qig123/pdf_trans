A complete characterization of the values of X for which ¬takes(X, his201) is
true would require a complete exploration of the resolution tree, something that
Prolog does only when all goals fail, or when repeatedly prompted with semi-
colons. Mechanisms to incorporate some sort of “constructive negation” into
logic programming are an active topic of research.
■
It is worth noting that the deﬁnition of \+ in terms of failure means that vari-

Negation and instantiation
able bindings are lost whenever \+ succeeds. For example:
```

```
?- takes(X, his201).
X = jane_doe
?- \+(takes(X, his201)).
false.
?- \+(\+(takes(X, his201))).
true.
% no value for X provided
```

```
When takes ﬁrst succeeds, X is bound to jane_doe. When the inner \+ fails,
the binding is broken. Then when the outer \+ succeeds, a new binding is created
to an uninstantiated value. Prolog provides no way to pull the binding of X out
through the double negation.

**Summary and Concluding Remarks**
In this chapter we have focused on the logic model of computing. Where an
imperative program computes principally through iteration and side effects, and
a functional program computes principally through substitution of parameters
into functions, a logic program computes through the resolution of logical state-
ments, driven by the ability to unify variables and terms.
Much of our discussion was driven by an examination of the principal logic
language, Prolog, which we used to illustrate clauses and terms, resolution and

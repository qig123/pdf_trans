**Address Space Organization**
Assemblers, linkers, and loaders typically operate on a pair of related ﬁle formats:
*relocatable* object code and* executable* object code. Relocatable object code is ac-
ceptable as input to a linker; multiple ﬁles in this format can be combined to
create an executable program. Executable object code is acceptable as input to a
loader: it can be brought into memory and run. A relocatable object ﬁle includes
the following descriptive information:

*Import table:* Identiﬁes instructions that refer to named locations whose ad-
dresses are unknown, but are presumed to lie in other ﬁles yet to be linked
to this one.

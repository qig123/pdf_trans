## A.1 Interpreters

We provide interpreters for each of the source languages LInt, LVar, â€¦ in the files interp-Lint.rkt, interp-Lvar.rkt, and so on. The interpreters for the inter- mediate languages CVar and CIf are in interp-Cvar.rkt and interp-C1.rkt. The interpreters for CTup, CFun, pseudo-x86, and x86 are in the interp.rkt file.

## A.2 Utility Functions

The utility functions described in this section are in the utilities.rkt file of the support code.

interp-tests This function runs the compiler passes and the interpreters on each of the specified tests to check whether each pass is correct. The interp-tests function has the following parameters:

name (a string) A name to identify the compiler. typechecker A function of exactly one argument that either raises an error using the error function when it encounters a type error, or returns #f when it encounters a type error. If there is no type error, the type checker returns the program. passes A list with one entry per pass. An entry is a list consisting of four things:

* a string giving the name of the pass;
* the function that implements the pass (a translator from AST to AST);
* a function that implements the interpreter (a function from AST to result
  value) for the output language; and,
* a type checker for the output language. Type checkers for all the L and C
  languages are provided in the support code. For example, the type checkers
  for LVar and CVar are in type-check-Lvar.rkt and type-check-Cvar.rkt.
  The type checker entry is optional. The support code does not provide type
  checkers for the x86 languages.
  source-interp An interpreter for the source language. The interpreters from
  appendix A.1 make a good choice.
  test-family (a string) For example, "var" or "cond".

tests A list of test numbers that specifies which tests to run (explained next).

The interp-tests function assumes that the subdirectory tests has a collection of Racket programs whose names all start with the family name, followed by an underscore and then the test number, and ending with the file extension .rkt. Also, for each test program that calls read one or more times, there is a file with the same name except that the file extension is .in, which provides the input for the Racket program. If the test program is expected to fail type checking, then there should be an empty file of the same name with extension .tyerr.

compiler-tests This function runs the compiler passes to generate x86 (a .s file) and then runs the GNU C compiler (gcc) to generate machine code. It runs the machine code and checks that the output is 42. The parameters to the compiler-tests function are similar to those of the interp-tests function, and they consist of

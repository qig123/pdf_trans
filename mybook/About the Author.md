Michael L. Scott is a professor and past chair of the Department of Computer Sci-
ence at the University of Rochester. He received his Ph.D. in computer sciences in
1985 from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. From 2014–2015 he was a Vis-
iting Scientist at Google. His research interests lie at the intersection of program-
ming languages, operating systems, and high-level computer architecture, with an
emphasis on parallel and distributed computing. His MCS mutual exclusion lock,
co-designed with John Mellor-Crummey, is used in a variety of commercial and
academic systems. Several other algorithms, co-designed with Maged Michael,
Bill Scherer, and Doug Lea, appear in the java.util.concurrent standard li-
brary. In 2006 he and Dr. Mellor-Crummey shared the ACM SIGACT/SIGOPS
Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing.
Dr. Scott is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, a Fellow of
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and a member of Usenix, the
Union of Concerned Scientists, and the American Association of University Pro-
fessors. The author of more than 150 refereed publications, he served as General
Chair of the 2003 ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP) and
as Program Chair of the 2007 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Transactional Com-
puting (TRANSACT), the 2008 ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and
Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP), and the 2012 International Confer-
ence on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Sys-
tems (ASPLOS). In 2001 he received the University of Rochester’s Robert and
Pamela Goergen Award for Distinguished Achievement and Artistry in Under-
graduate Teaching.

*Figure 5.1 shows the definition of the concrete syntax of LWhile, and figure 5.2 shows the definition of its abstract syntax. The definitional interpreter for LWhile is shown in figure 5.3. We add new cases for SetBang, WhileLoop, Begin, and Void, and we make changes to the cases for Var and Let regarding variables. To support assign- ment to variables and to make their lifetimes indefinite (see the second example in section 8.2), we box the value that is bound to each variable (in Let). The case for Var unboxes the value. Now we discuss the new cases. For SetBang, we find the variable in the environment to obtain a boxed value, and then we change it using set-box! to the result of evaluating the right-hand side. The result value of a SetBang is #<void>. For the WhileLoop, we repeatedly (1) evaluate the condition, and if the result is true, (2) evaluate the body. The result value of a while loop*
